CS 244 '15: Reproducing Mosh Paper Results

Setting up the test server on EC2:
Create an EC2 instance following the intstructions listed here: 
http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs244/ec2setup.html
Select the AMI CS244-Spr15-Mininet or ami-cba48cfb on us-west-2
Select the c3.large instance type
Configure the security group to allow SSH access
Log into your EC2 instance and verify mininet by running:
sudo mn --link tc,bw=10 --test iperf
For more detailed instructions, see the link above.

Setup:
git clone https://github.com/kjtmckenzie/mosh_test.git
cd mosh_test
sudo ./setup.sh

Running the setup.sh script will install all the relevant packages
needed for the Mosh experiment.  It may ask you for a "y" or "yes"
to confirm the package installation.

Run the experiment:
sudo ./run.sh

This will take roughly 2 hours, and it will generate 5 graphs in the 
mosh_test directory: 3G.png, 3G_FLAKY.png, 4G_LTE.png, 4G_LTE_FLAKY.png
and WIFI.png.  These show the same results of the Mosh paper for 
various mobile technologies. The original Mosh-paper only included 
results for 3G, so the 3G and 3G_FLAKY results are the most 
representative of the results were are trying to emulate.

We used the following statistics gathered from real-world data
by using the FCC Speed Test app at various locations around Escondido
Village.

Note: DELAY measures 1/2 of the RTT.  JITTER is the amount any
one link's bandwidth can change.  A JITTER_FACTOR of .5 means
a link could go from .5x bandwidth to 1.5x bandwidth.  Bandwidth
and delay are in milliseconds.

Tech: 4G_LTE
    BANDWIDTH = 26.0
    DELAY = 44.5
    JITTER_FACTOR = .22 
    DROP_RATE = 0.0 
Tech: 4G_LTE_FLAKY
    BANDWIDTH = 3.0
    DELAY = 67.5
    JITTER_FACTOR = 0.60
    DROP_RATE = 0.063  
Tech: 3G
    BANDWIDTH = 3.0
    DELAY = 61.5
    JITTER_FACTOR = 0.48
    DROP_RATE = 0.013
Tech: 3G_FLAKY
    BANDWIDTH = 0.9
    DELAY = 74.5
    JITTER_FACTOR = 0.80
    DROP_RATE = 0.087
Tech: WIFI
    BANDWIDTH = 68
    DELAY = 4.0
    JITTER_FACTOR = 0.76
    DROP_RATE = 0.0
